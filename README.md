* BTC-7e-HP5: Directory in GitHub Site where image for BTC-7E-HP5 can be found
* BTC-8e-HP5: Direcotry in GitHub Site where image for BTC-8E-HP5 can be found
* BA (Bundle A) : A set of customizations aimed at improving overall camera usability 
 * Custom Ribbon: In "Playback" menu, the date and time of the photo/video are shown is larger font at the bottom of the playback screen, making it easier to tell when the image was taken when reviewing in the field. 
 * Night Video Limit: The default manufacturer firmware limits night time (flash illuminated) videos to 20 Seconds.  This option removes that limit, allowing illuminated videos of the same duration as daylight videos.
 * Custom Info Strip: Adds "seconds" to the time of day in the info strip.  
* DSLR Trigger: Causes the "aim led" to turn on whenever a photo or video is taken.  This LED can be used to trigger a DSLR camera, while also allowing the trail camera to take photos or video.


## Download Instructions
- Find the copy of brnbtc72.BRN (BTC-7E-HP5) or brnbtc82.BRN (BTC-8E-HP5) file you're interested in one of the folders here
- Click on it; then press "Download"
- Copy this file onto an SD card at the "top level" (not into a folder on SD card).  
- Note -- the file must be named "brnbtc72.BRN" (for BTC-7E-HP5) or "brnbtc82.BRN" (for the BTC-8E-HP5).  Sometimes downloading from your browser will add extra characters to distinguish it from previous downloads -- e.g. "brnbtc72(1).BRN".  If this happens, rename file to "brnbtc72.BRN" (or "brnbtc82.BRN") on the SD card. 

## FW install Instructions

Before installing new firmware, make sure you have batteries that will easily power the camera for the several minutes it takes for firmware upgrade. Losing power during firmware upgrade is bad, requiring that the camera be reprogrammed by the manufacturer.  

On BTC-7E-HP5 or BTC-8E-HP5
- Press "Mode" button 
- Select "CAMERA SETUP"
- Select "FW UPGRADE"
- Select "YES"

Display should show "UPGRADING".  Loading the firmware should take about 20 seoconds. DO NOT TURN OFF OR REMOVE BATTERIES DURING THIS TIME! (this will "brick" the camera).  

Camera will then "Reboot" with new firmware.

Note that updating firmware resets the camera configuration settings, including the date and time. 

## Reinstalling Factory Firmware
If, for any reason, you want to get back to the factory firmware, choose the "Baseline" entry in the table above to get the baseline factory image, and install that
