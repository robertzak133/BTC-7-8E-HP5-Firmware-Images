# BTC-7-8-E-HP5-Firmware-Images
This repository formerly contained firmware images for BTC-7E-HP5 and BTC-8E-HP5 Browning Trail Cameras.

As of 2023-07-12 this repository, dedicated to the BTC-{7,8}E-HP5 trail cameras has been superceded by a new repository which contains a unified set of custom firmware images for BTC{7,8}{E, E-HP4, E-HP5} cameras, as well as the source code and tools I wrote to produces these images.
